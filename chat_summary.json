Following this, the AI offered a list of additional features to enhance the website's functionality, including a dropdown menu under 'About' for FAQs and support, a 'Recent Transactions' page, and a user profile icon for account management, among others. Some suggested features like a search bar and a 'Settings' link were not checked, indicating either a lack of interest or relevance at the moment. To further tailor the website, the AI asked whether the user preferred a fixed or scrollable navbar and if the navbar's style should match the existing website theme. \n\nSubsequently, the user requested the addition of a navbar component with similar navlinks. The AI again proposed several features, this time more focused on Ethereum, such as a real-time Ethereum transaction tracker and notifications for unusual transactions. User account management was another feature of interest, while suggestions like an interactive Ethereum price chart and dark mode were not pursued. Questions concerning the 'Hello World' button's position within the app and the action upon clicking were posed, offering choices between a prominent main screen placement or a more discreet inclusion in the settings menu, and whether it should display a pop-up message or navigate to a new page. The AI then requested more details about the project to understand and implement the 'Hello World' button request accurately. This conversation illustrates the user's gradual website enhancement process, incorporating both aesthetic and functional elements, while also indicating a focus on Ethereum-related features.",
